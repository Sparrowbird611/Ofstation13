	the Lactera are the frontline soldiers of the invaders. Although at one point they were a distinct species with their own culture and free will, psionic enslavement by the Allophylus has changed that. \
	Born in a laboratory and raised for the sole purpose of killing, they are creatures genetically modified to be an ideal soldier. \
	Without fear, or regard for their own lives, they are extremely dangerous, despite being relatively fragile. \
	Indeed, they do not feel pain, they do not need to breathe, and their feet are implanted with a magnetic traction system. Driven only by a desire to kill, they can psionically \
	communicate with the other members of their hivemind in order to work effectively as a unit."
