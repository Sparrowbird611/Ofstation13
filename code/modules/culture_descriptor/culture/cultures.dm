	description = "You are from the surface of Mars. Raised in one of the many farming communities or one of the great cities such as Olympus. Most of the surfacers \
	are known as Monsians, the largest cultural group on the planet. Most Surfacers have had a decent upbringing and represent the \
	average level of comfort expected in Sol space. Most surfacers are like many across the galaxy, though a few harbour rivalries with other Martian cultural \
	groups or are generally overly proud of their heritage, as is the case with the Gideons, to the point that they constantly refer to it."

	description = "You are one of the people of the UnderCities of Mars. The UnderCities, originally built as 'temporary' living space while the cities above them \
	were constructed, have since grown far beyond their original scope and have now spread out underneath the red planet. Tunnellers, despite typically having access \
	to the same amenities and services as Surfacers are somewhat poorer than their aboveground brethren as a result of their less desirable locale as well as a strong \
	criminal presence stemming from centuries of poor policing and a focus on the surface by the martian government. Most Tunnellers are resilient, though distrusting \

	of one of the various corporations, persons hired in service roles in one of the many prefectures or a resident of New Vegas. The 'poor' of Luna typically resent the rich because of their \

	Luna's upper class isn't equal; generally divided between new, corporate money and old, dynastic money; many members of the old dynasties look down on the newly wealthy. \

	have far lower standards of living than those above. A hardy people who spend much of their time working in mostly unpleasant conditions in order to prop up the society above, \
	surfacers are a people who value hard work, solidarity, unity and democracy. Unfortunately, while they support noble ideals, the reality of their situation does not always \

	the belters of today are primarily engaged in the mechanical services, engineering, shipbuilding and maintenance industries. Belters are quite varied, and something of a melting \
	pot owing to the sheer number of transient workers, hauler crews and government and corporate employees basing themselves around the great shipyards of Ceres. This has led to belter \
	culture being mainly about embracing change, new people and new experiences, as well as a sense of pride in their work, as the reputation of Ceres shipbuilding is widely known across \

	much of the planet's infrastructure being unstable or outright falling apart. This, coupled with rampant corruption and the large influence of criminal organisations across much of \
	the planet has led to the people of Pluto having something of a seedy reputation, its citizens being viewed with disrepute. The people themselves, however, are usually \
	just happy to get off the rock and to healthier locales. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of the wider SA, many Plutonians tend to maintain criminal ties, even offworld."

	countries have at least two arcologies which make up much of the population, with the remaining humans living in small villages or from one of the many nature preserve communes. \
	The long recovery period of Earth has resulted in much of the population being environmentally aware and heavily conservationist, eager to avoid past mistakes. Most Earthers are \

	vital goods, a lonely outpost on the edge of a dreary backwater, such people are raised in small, confined environments with few others, and tend to be most familiar with older, reliable but outdated \
